<h1 style="text-align:center"> Building a safety net for households in India.</h1>
<p> Back in 2008, insurance customers in India were facing a tough time. There was lack of information on products, transparency was missing, mis-selling was rampant, there was a high lapse rate of insurance policies and consumers felt a general apathy towards the insurance industry. Insurance companies made profits from policy surrender charges and the entire industry was mired in murkiness.
  <br>
<br>
  That is when a small bunch of people, with no insurance experience, started re-imagining what the insurance space could be. They imagined a place where consumers could find completely transparent insurance information, and an option to research and compare insurance products so they could buy what they really wanted to. A place where all communications would be recorded so that there would be a clear audit trail of who said what in a product as complex as insurance. A place that provided a common service layer for all consumer services and claims.

  With this grand ambition as their life goal, this motley crew of people started their journey into what is now Policybazaar.com.
